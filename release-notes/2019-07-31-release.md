## The enemy of my enemy is my friend

When prey encounters predator, escape is often the best form of defense. Unfortunately this is not an option for plants, who instead have evolved a range of chemical defenses to deter herbivores, such as insects and other arthropods. These chemical defenses include compounds that are toxic to herbivores (direct defense) as well as [compounds that attract herbivore predators](http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/149/1/96.short) (indirect defense).

Indirect defense has been extensively studied in maize. Upon foliar damage by lepidopteran larvae, maize releases a complex volatile terpenoid mixture, which [attracts parasitic wasps](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296628), like [_Cotesia marginiventris_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/93006) or [_Cotesia sesamiae_](http://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/89807). These wasps deposit eggs in the lepidopteran larvae, which leads to an understandable loss of appetite by the lepidopterans, and eventually their death, when the wasp finally emerges from its host. These volatile terpenoids can also 'prime' neighboring plants, causing them to increase the transcription of defense-related genes and [respond faster and more vigorously to subsequent herbivore attacks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16469918) .

The volatile terpenoid mixture produced by maize under lepidopteran attack includes one sesquiterpene of special interest, which is (E)"-beta-caryophyllene":https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/searchId.do?chebiId=CHEBI:10357. This same sesquiterpene is also [produced by roots upon damage by root-feeding pests, such as western corn rootworm ( _Diabrotica virgifera virgifera_ )](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15815622). Here it [attracts entomopathogenic nematodes, which also live parasitically inside the infected lepidopterans](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296628). (E)-beta-caryophyllene is produced by the (E)-beta-caryophyllene synthase encoded by TPS23, which catalyzes the [cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to (E)-beta-caryophyllene](https://www.rhea-db.org/reaction?id=28294). As expected for a gene involved in plant defense, [TPS23 gene expression is tightly regulated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18296628). Herbivore-induced leaf damage causes increased expression in leaves, but not in roots, while attack by root-feeding pests increases expression in roots, but not in the shoots. TPS23 transcript levels correlate with the production of (E)-beta-caryophyllene and [high-level expressing maize lines are more resistant to herbivores than low-level expressing ones](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29151152) .

(E)-beta-caryophyllene is just one of a host of chemical deterrents that plants deploy against herbivores and other pests: the UniProt [plant annotation program](https://www.uniprot.org/biocuration_project/Plants) aims to capture knowledge of the relevant biochemical pathways using Rhea and ChEBI, as well as many other aspects of plant biology too. Find out more about [maize TPS23](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=accession:B2C4D0) in the latest updated version of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

# UniProtKB news

## Cross-references to ChEBI in the ptmlist.txt document file

The ptmlist.txt document, which is available by [FTP](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/knowledgebase/docs/ptmlist.txt) and on the [website](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/docs/ptmlist), describes post-translational modifications (PTMs) annotated in the UniProt knowledgebase. This release sees the addition of optional cross-references from ptmlist.txt to [ChEBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) (Chemical Entities of Biological Interest), a freely available dictionary of molecular entities focused on small chemical compounds and derivatives, including modified residues.

Example:

    ID   (3R)-3-hydroxyarginine
    AC   PTM-0476
    FT   MOD_RES
    ..
    KW   Hydroxylation.
    DR   ChEBI; CHEBI:78294.

This new mapping to ChEBI will facilitate the integration of data on PTMs with knowledge of enzymatic reactions described in UniProt using the [Rhea](https://www.rhea-db.org/) knowledgebase of biochemical reactions (itself built on ChEBI). The following query allows users to find enzymes in UniProtKB that are capable of creating the modified (3R)-3-hydroxyarginine residue (PTM-0476, CHEBI:78294):

[annotation:(type:"catalytic activity" chebi:"(3R)-3-hydroxy-L-arginine residue \[78294\]")](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=annotation%3A%28type%3A%22catalytic+activity%22+chebi%3A%22%283R%29-3-hydroxy-L-arginine+residue+%5B78294%5D%22%29)

We have currently mapped over 120 of the most common PTMs in UniProtKB to ChEBI and will continue to add new cross-references to ChEBI in forthcoming releases. This mapping of PTMs to ChEBI is part of our ongoing work on the standardization of knowledge of small molecule chemistry in UniProtKB that now covers enzyme cofactors and reactions as well as PTMs, and that will eventually extend to all small molecule protein interactions. We welcome your feedback on these current and future developments.

## Retirement of UniProt decoy databases

Based on usage statistics, we decided to retire the UniProt decoy databases from our FTP site. If you wish to generate decoy databases from UniProt FASTA databases, you can [use this software](https://metacpan.org/release/InSilicoSpectro-Databanks) .

Please [contact us](https://www.uniprot.org/contact) if you have questions about this change.
