### Prenylation for antiviral activity

We are not equal before viral infections. Take SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. During the pandemic the severity of the disease ranged from no symptoms at all to death, for [at least 15 million individuals](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35513455/). Many factors can contribute to these differences, from environmental, such as deficiencies in diet, exercise, or sleep, to genetic ones, such as those contributing to the [efficiency of the type I interferon response](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34494617,32972995,32972996,34413140,34213846,33322160,34494617,35444807). Among the latter, [2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase 1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00973) (OAS1) has been the focus of [several recent studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=34342578,35027740,34581622,33633408).

OAS1 is a sensor of viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Binding to dsRNA induces a [conformational change in OAS1 and its activation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25892109/). Activated OAS1 catalyzes the polymerization of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) into a second messenger, 2'-5'-oligoadenylate (2'-5'A), which then binds monomeric ribonuclease L (RNase L) leading to its dimerization and subsequent activation. RNase L degrades cellular and viral RNA and [blocks viral replication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24578532/). OAS1 is expressed in the respiratory tract, a location perfectly suited to protect from SARS-CoV-2 infections, and [binds two conserved stem loops in SARS-CoV-2 5'-untranslated region (UTR)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34581622/) with great specificity.

But there is more to it. OAS1 gene encodes at least [4 different proteins generated by alternative splicing](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00973#sequences). The predominant isoforms, called p46 and p42, have a common catalytic activity, but differ in the inclusion of the terminal exon, where a prenylation site is encoded. Contrary to p42, p46 is [geranylgeranylated](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34342578/) and this makes a great deal of difference. In cultured cells, [only p46, not p42, can inhibit SARS-CoV-2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34581622/), unless a prenylation site is engineered into p42, suggesting that targeting to membranes is crucial for OAS1 effectiveness. [Preliminary clinical investigations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34581622/) also show that COVID-19 patients who do not express p46 are statistically more likely to develop severe COVID-19, i.e., to be admitted to the intensive care unit.

The explanation may lie in the fact that positive-strand RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, picornaviruses, and coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, replicate their RNA within [modified host organelles of the endomembrane system](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25054883/). Membrane-bound OAS1 colocalizes with these organelles, where it can ideally detect viral RNAs and initiate their destruction. In support of this hypothesis, OAS1 effectiveness was demonstrated not only against SARS-CoV-2, but [also against other viruses that form replicative organelles](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23196181,24284630,27395032,34581622,34342578), while there was no inhibition of other respiratory RNA viruses, such as human [parainfluenza virus type 3 and human respiratory syncytial virus](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34581622/), which do not use this type of vesicle.

The alternative splicing event which leads to p46 production and efficient antiviral response hangs by a thread, or rather by a single nucleotide variation within the last OAS1 intron, [A>G (rs10774671)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/rs10774671). The presence of G at this location creates a splice acceptor site, allowing the inclusion of the last exon, hence that of the crucial prenylation site, while in the presence of A, the last exon is skipped. Unfortunately, the A allele is the major one in the overall human population with a [frequency of 66%](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/variant/12-113357193-G-A), although in some ethnic groups the prevalence of the G allele is higher, in people of African ancestry, for instance, its frequency is about 58%. Fortunately, prenylated OAS1 is likely only one of multiple interferon-stimulated genes that mediate the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.

As of this release, the updated [OAS1 entry](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00973) is publicly available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot.

## UniParc news

### Version numbers for identifiers in Ensembl cross-references

In UniParc cross-references to Ensembl, we are now using version numbers for Ensembl identifiers wherever possible.

#### XML format

Example: [UPI000442D01A](https://rest.uniprot.org/uniparc/UPI000442D01A.xml)

Previous format:
