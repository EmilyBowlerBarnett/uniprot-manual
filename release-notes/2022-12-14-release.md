## Plant adaptation to global warming through epigenetic memory

While we humans are organizing large conferences to find ways to [limit global warming](https://cop27.eg/#/vision#goals), plants elaborate sophisticated epigenetic strategies to adapt to it. Plant exposure to heat activates various genes and repetitive elements, that are normally silenced via transcriptional gene silencing, and releases post-transcriptional gene silencing by inhibiting siRNA biogenesis. Heat responses are usually transient and reset quickly to normal conditions, although there is some somatic stress memory with [a duration of several days](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28655328/). However, certain plant responses can also be transmitted to the next unstressed generation.

In 2014, Migicovsky et al. reported that extreme heat (50&#176;C)-stressed [_Arabidopsis thaliana_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/3702) show [accelerated flowering](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24513700/) and [this phenotype was also observed in the immediate unstressed progeny, where it is maternally transmitted](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=30778176+24513700). Recently certain molecular aspects of this phenomenon have been unraveled. By comparing gene expression in heat-stressed _A. thaliana_ and in its unstressed second generation progeny, which both exhibit the same early flowering phenotype, [Liu et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30778176/) observed that the [SGS3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9LDX1) gene was down-regulated in both generations. SGS3 is essential for the biogenesis of trans-acting siRNAs. The resulting decrease in siRNAs leads to the up-regulation of HTT5, a protein required for early flowering. SGS3 down-regulation was mediated by the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase SGIP1, which is up-regulated following heat stress and targets SGS3 to proteasomal degradation. [Liu et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30778176/) explored further upstream to find the regulators of this cascade of events and found two genes whose expression was induced by heat. They are the heat shock transcription factor HSFA2 that directly activates the H3K27me3 demethylase REF6. REF6 in turn derepresses the HSFA2 gene, which together establish a heritable feedback loop. REF6 and HSFA2 activate SGIP1 and HTT5 transcription in concert. In conclusion, H3K27me3 demethylation and HSFA2 activation might be key events in the pathway of heat sensing in plants. The actual primary heat sensors are still elusive and the transmission of thermomemory remains a mystery. It should be noted, however, that it is not the first time that epigenetic memory transmission was reported. [In _C. elegans_, exposure to bisphenol A causes the derepression of an epigenomically silenced transgene in the germline for 5 generations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29791850/). This effect was associated with a reduction of the repressive marks H3K9me3 and H3K27me3.

Accelerating reproductive development has a cost for _A. thaliana_. HTT5 is not only involved in early flowering, but it also attenuates disease resistance. In this context, evolution has chosen growth over defense.

The updated UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries for _A. thaliana_ [REF6](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9STM3), [HSFA2](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/O80982), as well as their downstream targets [SGIP1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9SD71), [SGS3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9LDX1) and [HTT5](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8RY97) are available in the knowledgebase.
