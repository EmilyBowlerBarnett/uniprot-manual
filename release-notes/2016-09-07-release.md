# Headline

## Butterfly fashion: all they need is cortex

Butterfly and moth wing patterns fulfill various functions, such as mate attraction, thermal regulation, and protection by concealment, mimicry or warning. Patterns are produced by [a dust-like layer of tiny colored scales](http://www.learnaboutbutterflies.com/Anatomy%203.htm) that cover an otherwise transparent membrane. Scales can be pigmented with melanins resulting in black and brown colors. Blue, red and iridescence are usually created by the microstructure of the scales, resulting in the scattering of light. Each scale is produced by a single cell on the wing surface.

Wing pattern and color can change in order to adapt to environmental changes. The classical example of such a phenomenon is provided by [_Biston betularia_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/82595). This moth used to camouflage itself against lichen-covered tree trunks. Its peppered white wings makes it almost invisible on this background. With the advent of the industrial revolution in the 19th century in Britain, trunks turned soot black and so did _Biston betularia_. The new melanic morph was described for the first time in Manchester in 1848 and called _carbonaria_. It spread all over England and its frequency was over 90% in the 1950s. Several years after the Clean Air Act, in the early 1970s, its frequency started to drop again and nowadays the [maximum is evaluated less than 50% and in most places below 10%](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14737825) .

The mutation that gave rise to _Biston betularia_ industrial melanism [has just been identified](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251284). It is the insertion of a large, tandemly repeated, transposable element into the first intron of the _cort_ gene, which results in increased gene expression. The transposition event is thought to have occurred around 1819, which is consistent with the historical record. Surprisingly, the _cort_ gene does not encode a transcription factor that would be involved in the expression of pigmentation genes. Its only known function has been reported in _Drosophila_, where the _cort_ -encoded protein [cortex](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q960N3) is a cell-cycle regulator, [required for the completion of meiosis in oocytes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11252055,10683177,10924478,17251266,18020708). In [_Heliconius numata tarapotensis_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/884341) and [Heliconius melpomene rosina](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/171916), 2 butterfly species, cortex is expressed in final instar larval hindwing discs, in [regions fated to become black in the adult wing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251285). Although cortex function in the regulation of pigmentation patterning is yet unknown, the current hypothesis is that it may regulate scale cell development.

In other latitudes, butterflies escape from predators not by concealment, but by warning that they are unpalatable with bright and distinctive wing colors. Within a given area, experienced birds have been "educated" to avoid certain patterns. This pattern recognition varies upon geographical locations. As a result, in a given area, a number of butterfly species, edible or not, mimic each other and have the same color pattern, even though they may be only distantly related, while Lepidopteria of the same species found in other locations may exhibit very different patterns. A [recent study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27251285) focused on different [_Heliconius_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/33416) species living in South America. The result was quite striking. In these species too, the _cort_ gene appeared to be a major regulator of color and pattern. This result suggests that the recruitment of cortex to wing patterning may have occurred before the major diversification of the Lepidoptera. This gene has repeatedly been targeted by natural selection to generate both cryptic, as in _Biston betularia_, and [aposematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism), as in _Heliconius_ genus, patterns.

As of this release, UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot [_Biston betularia_, _Heliconius melpomene_ and _Heliconius erato_ cortex entries](<https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=citation:(id:27251285)%20OR%20citation:(id:27251284)&fil=reviewed%3Ayes>) have been updated with this new knowledge and are publicly available.

## Change of the cross-references to VectorBase

We have modified our cross-references to the [VectorBase](http://www.vectorbase.org/) database. We now use the VectorBase Transcript identifier as the primary resource identifier, while showing the VectorBase Protein and Gene identifiers in additional fields.

VectorBase is available at <http://vectorbase.org> .

# UniProt website news

## Peptide search tool

We have introduced a new tool called [Peptide search](https://www.uniprot.org/peptidesearch) that is available from a link in the header of the UniProt website. You can enter one or several peptide sequences (for example from a proteomics experiment) into the search field and the tool quickly finds all UniProtKB sequences that exactly match one of your query sequences. Searches can be restricted to a taxonomic subset of UniProtKB to decrease the search time. The tool returns a results page showing the matched UniProtKB entries in a design consistent with the UniProtKB text search results page, including filters on the left, results on the right and an option to customise the results table through the 'Columns' button.

## Publications view added to UniProtKB entries

UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) protein entries now have a dedicated view of publications relevant for a protein. UniProtKB contains more than 350,000 unique publications, with over 210,000 of these fully curated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and the remainder imported in UniProtKB/TrEMBL. This set is complemented by more than 640,000 additional publications that have been computationally mapped from other resources to UniProtKB entries. The publications annotated in UniProtKB have previously been displayed in the main 'Entry' view and a link provided access to a separate page that listed the computationally mapped publications. We have now combined all publications into a new 'Publications' view that can be accessed from a link under the 'Display' heading on the left hand side of a UniProtKB page. In this view you can filter the publications list by source and categories that are based on the type of data a publication contains about the protein (such as function, interaction, sequence, etc.) or the number of proteins it describes ('small scale' vs 'large scale'), see for example [P10276](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P10276/publications) .
