### A phospholipase for clear vision

The eye is a fascinating and complex organ, made of three main tissue types, the cornea, lens and retina. The \[eye lens\](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lens%5F(anatomy%29) is a transparent and biconvex structure which allows the passage of light, focusing it on the retina. To achieve their specific refractive properties, lens cells differentiate to contain an extraordinarily high concentration of crystallin proteins. They also have to get rid of organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and highly diffracting nuclei and mitochondria, to ensure clear vision. This process is under tight spatiotemporal control, proceeding from the center of the lens to the periphery to form an organelle-free zone. Failure of this process leads to a cloudy lens, in other words a cataract.

Some components in the eye lens differentiation process have been identified. The transcription factor [HSF4 has been previously shown to be instrumental](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15483628,15593327,28981088) , although its precise action is unclear. It has also been shown that [the degradation of nuclear DNA requires lysosomal DNASE2B](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12944971,17509075,18055814) . But until recently the process of organelle clearance remained quite elusive. Macroautophagy seemed to be a sensible hypothesis, as it is involved in organelle clearance during red blood cell differentiation for instance. However, this hypothesis has been discarded, as [knockout mice lacking Atg5 or Pik3c3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16300732,23479732) , two genes required for autophagy, exhibit normal organelle degradation during lens development.

Recently, [Morishita et al.](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33854238/) achieved a real breakthrough with a very efficient, though cumbersome approach. Using zebrafish as an animal model, they knocked out, one by one, all the genes that are highly expressed in the lens. In the [plaat1 knockout](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A0A0R4IY06) , the disappearance of mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum in the lens was almost completely suppressed. The knockout of the orthologous gene in mouse, called [Plaat3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8R3U1) , gave a similar result: there was almost no degradation of mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum or lysosomes in the developing lens. PLAAT proteins are phospholipases, that exhibit both [phospholipase A1 (PLA1) and A2 (PLA2) activities](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18614531,19047760,19136964,22134920) , and hence they catalyze the calcium-independent release of fatty acids from the sn-1 or sn-2 position of glycerophospholipids. In the context of lens, the lipase activity was required for rupture of organelles. During lens differentiation, PLAAT cytosolic enzymes are recruited to the organelles to be degraded after a mysterious membrane-damaging event. The cause of the membrane damage that initiates PLAAT recruitment and the cascade of organelle membrane degradation is unknown, but it is dependent upon HSF4 expression. One hypothesis is that high levels of expression of cytosolic proteins induced by HSF4, such as crystallins, may cause the membrane damage. What is the fate of the proteins released during organelle degradation? Are they degraded through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway? What happens to the free fatty acids that are generated by PLAAT activity? These questions and many others remain open, but some (refracted) light has been shed on an until recently obscure process.

UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entries for [plaat1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A0A0R4IY06) , [PLAAT3](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=accession:Q5R611+OR+accession:Q8R3U1+OR+accession:P53816+OR+accession:P53817) and [HSF4](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/?query=accession:Q1HGE8+OR+accession:Q5CZP2+OR+accession:Q9ULV5+OR+accession:Q9R0L1) have been updated with new information.

### Cross-references to MANE-Select

Cross-references have been added to the MANE-Select (Matched Annotation between NCBI and EBI) transcript resource. Matched Annotation from NCBI and EMBL-EBI (MANE) is a collaboration between the NCBI and the EMBL-EBI with the goal to provide a minimal set of matching RefSeq and Ensembl transcripts of human protein-coding genes.

**MANE Select** aims at providing one high-quality representative transcript per protein-coding gene that is well-supported by experimental data and represents the biology of the gene.

MANE-Select is available at <https://www.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/mane.html> and <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/MANE/> .

The format of the explicit links is:

|                        |                                |

### Removal of the cross-references to GeneDB

Cross-references to GeneDB have been removed.

### Change of ECO code associated with the GOA evidence 'Inferred from Electronic Annotation' (IEA)

Following a decision of the Gene Ontology (GO), we now associate, in Gene Ontology annotations, the evidence type \['Inferred from Electronic Annotation' (IEA)\](http://wiki.geneontology.org/index.php/Inferred%5Ffrom%5FElectronic%5FAnnotation%5F(IEA%29) with the Evidence Ontology (ECO) term

['computational evidence used in automatic assertion'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO%5F0007669) , identified with ECO:0007669

replacing the previously used

['evidence used in automatic assertion'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ECO%5F0000501) , identified with ECO:0000501.

This affects the RDF formats of UniProtKB/GOA data.

## RDF news

### Change of the RDF representation of our cross-references to RefSeq

We have modified the RDF description of our cross-references to protein resources in the RefSeq database to provide explicit links to their corresponding RefSeq nucleotide sequences.

Previously, our cross-references showed the identifier of a RefSeq nucleotide sequence through an `rdfs:comment` property with a string literal value. We have replaced this by a `translatedFrom` property that links the RefSeq protein to a resource that corresponds to its coding sequence (CDS) and, similarly to the description of EMBL-CDS resources, this CDS links through a `locatedOn` property to the transcript or genomic sequence that contains it.

Note that the `translatedFrom` property is not the inverse of the `translatedTo` property that is used, for instance, in the description of Ensembl cross-references. The latter is used to link mature transcripts (whose sequence includes untranslated regions in addition to the CDS) to proteins.

### Change of predicate in the cross-references RDF representation of tissues.

To be consistent between the RDF representation of tissues with the other controlled vocabularies we provide, the tissues cross-references now use the `rdfs:comment` predicate instead of the previously used `rdfs:label` predicate.
