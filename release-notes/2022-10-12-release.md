## The (phenolic) Rings of Power

When walking in the countryside, you may have noticed very small insects with very delicate white wings, looking a little like tiny butterflies, flitting around when a leaf or a stem is disturbed. In spite of their harmless appearance, whiteflies, including [_Bemisia tabaci_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/7038), are a pest that not only causes damage by feeding on plant sap, but is also a vector for a multitude of plant viruses and causes major crop loss around the world. Whiteflies are able to attack over 600 plant species. Luckily many plants have developed efficient anti-herbivore chemicals for their defense. These include phenolic glycosides, which strongly affect growth, development, and behavior of insect herbivores. Phenolic glycosides are also toxic to the plants that produce them, but plants detoxify them [by attaching a malonyl group to phenolic glucosides](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20626660/), a reaction catalyzed by malonyltransferases. Malonylated glycosides can then be safely stored in plant vacuoles. Incidentally this process is also used by plants for xenobiotic detoxification, and can lead to herbicide resistance, for instance.

In tomato leaves, some [290 different phenolic glycosides have been identified](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33770502/), several of which have been shown to be toxic to _B. tabaci_ only when ingested at higher doses than those found in plant [phloem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phloem). Where does this insect resistance to physiological levels of phenolic glycosides come from? Thorough examination of _B. tabaci_ genes led to [the discovery of BtPMaT1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33770502/), a gene encoding an insect glucoside malonyltrasferase. BtPMaT1 is widely expressed in _B. tabaci_ at all stages of life, with highest levels in the adult gut, a perfect location for food detoxification. Feeding _B. tabaci_ on transgenic tomatoes, expressing BtPMaT1 gene fragments that efficiently silence BtPMaT1, leads to increased whitefly mortality and decreased malonylated flavonoid glycosides in [honeydew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeydew_%28secretion%29), convincingly demonstrating that BtPMaT1 catalyzes malonylation of phenolic glycosides _in vivo_.

_B. tabaci_ BtPMaT1 gene has no homologue in other arthropods, not even in the related greenhouse whitefly, [_Trialeurodes vaporariorum_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/88556), but it carries significant similarity to plant enzymes. Phylogenetic analysis shows BtPMaT1 clusters [within a group of plant BAHD acyltransferases](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33770502/). All evidence points to one conclusion: BtPMaT1 has been horizontally acquired from plants. The horizontal transfer must have taken place after the divergence from Trialeurodes (some 86 million years ago). Horizontal transfer is a well-known process in prokaryotes, but we are just beginning to appreciate its importance in the adaptive evolution of eukaryotes.

Happily, you don't have to wait 80 million years to find the [newly created UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot BtPMaT1 entry](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P0DUQ3/entry) which is now available in our knowledgebase.
