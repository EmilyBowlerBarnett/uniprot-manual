# Headlines

While UniProt is a central resource for biologists, some specialized information is beyond the scope of our database. Therefore we link UniProtKB entries to more specialized resources:

- the `cross-reference` section links an entry to up to almost 100 different databases
- the `web resource` section links an entry to other related web pages

We recently added links to the free encyclopedia Wikipedia in the `web resource` section. [Proteins with a link to Wikipedia](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=web:wikipedia) are mainly of medical or pharmaceutical interest. Wikipedia articles may describe the discovery of the protein and its use in medicine.

Examples:

- [Erythropoeitin (P01588)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P01588#section_web)
- [Renin (P00797)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00797#section_web)
- [Insulin (P01308)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P01308#section_web)
- [Ghrelin (Q9UBU3)](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9UBU3#section_web)
