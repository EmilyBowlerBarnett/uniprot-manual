## Biological weapons in the struggle for life

The apoplast, the extracellular space between plant cells, is a battleground between plants and attacking microorganisms. The battle often starts with the secretion of carbohydrate-degrading enzymes by the invader and a counter-attack by the plant with dedicated enzyme inhibitors. This happens for instance when [_Phytophthora sojae_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/1094619) invades soybean. During very early infection stages (20 minutes to 2 hours), the oomycete expresses and secretes high levels of a xyloglucanase enzyme, called [XEG1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/G4ZHR2). XEG1 degrades the plant cell wall polymers and not only permits pathogen invasion, but also provides it with nutrients. XEG1 expression declines rapidly from 3 hours onwards.

Like other plants, soybean monitors the apoplastic environment through pattern recognition receptors and [recognizes XEG1 as a PAMP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26163574) (pathogen-associated molecular pattern). This recognition triggers defense responses, which include the secretion of [GIP1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/I1JNS6), a xyloglucanase inhibitor. Efficient XEG1 inhibition by GIP1 increases soybean resistance towards _P. sojae_. This could be the end of the story, but _P. sojae_ has another trick up its sleeve.

When [Ma et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28082413) studied GIP1 binding to XEG1 paralogs, they retrieved only one protein, called [XLP1](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/G4ZHR3), in addition to XEG1. Like XEG1, XLP1 is targeted to the apoplast. It also shows a similar expression time course to XEG1, i.e.Â high levels during very early infection stages, followed by a rapid decline, suggesting a role in virulence. Unlike XEG1, however, XLP1 does not show any xyloglucanase activity. It is 52 residues shorter and is missing one of the residues critical for xyloglucanase activity. XLP1 contributes to _P. sojae_ infectivity, but only in the presence of active XEG1. Thus XLP1 acts as a decoy to disrupt plant defenses. It interacts with GIP1 with a five-fold higher affinity than that of XEG1 and hence neutralizes the GIP1 inhibitor. In this setting, XEG1 can pursue plant cell wall digestion without any hindrance.

The [3 belligerent proteins](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb?query=accession:G4ZHR2+OR+accession:I1JNS6+OR+accession:G4ZHR3) have been annotated in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and are publicly available.

# UniProtKB news

## Change of annotation topic 'Sequence caution'

The annotation topic [Sequence caution](https://www.uniprot.org/help/sequence_caution) reports differences between the protein sequence shown in a UniProtKB entry and other available protein sequences derived from the same gene. It indicates the likely cause for the differences, and when that cause is a frameshift or erroneous termination, the amino acid sequence position(s) of these errors were listed when possible. Since it is nowadays easy to align two protein sequences for comparison, we no longer curate error positions and removed the field where this information was stored.

### Text format

We removed the optional `Positions` field.

Example: [P14332](https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P14332.txt)

Previous format:

    CC   -!- SEQUENCE CAUTION: Sequence=CAA34633.1; Type=Frameshift; Positions=226, 249; Evidence={ECO:0000305};

New format:

    CC   -!- SEQUENCE CAUTION: Sequence=CAA34633.1; Type=Frameshift; Evidence={ECO:0000305};

### XML format

This change did not affect the [UniProtKB XSD](https://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot.xsd) .

Example: [P14332](https://rest.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P14332.xml)

### RDF format

This change required an adaptation of the hierarchy of [`Annotation`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/Annotation) classes in the [UniProt RDF schema ontology](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/rdf/core.owl) : The [`Sequence_Caution_Annotation`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/Sequence_Caution_Annotation) class is no longer an `rdfs:subClassOf` of the [`Sequence_Annotation`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/Sequence_Annotation) class, but a direct `rdfs:subClassOf` of the [`Annotation`](http://purl.uniprot.org/core/Annotation) class.
