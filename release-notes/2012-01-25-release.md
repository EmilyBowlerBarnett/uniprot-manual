## What’s in a (species) name?

Carl Linnaeus, the father of taxonomy, was responsible during his life for the naming of nearly 8,000 plants, many animals and the scientific designation for humans: _Homo sapiens_. Linnaeus used many of his supporters and detractors as inspiration for naming plants. The most beautiful plants were often named in honor of his supporters while his detractors often supplied the names of common weeds or unattractive plants. Rather like an artist signing a painting, Linnaeus signed all his descriptions, his signature becoming over the centuries a simple L followed by a point. Sober. Even to this day taxonomically approved names may use this idea, but less soberly; the red alga [_Gracilaria chilensis_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/2775) was discovered in 1986 by C.J. Bird, J. McLachlan & E.C. Oliveira, giving us _Gracilaria chilensis_ C.J. Bird, J. McLachlan & E.C. Oliveira, 1986.

Linnaeus advocated the use of commemorative personal names as botanical names. In ‘Critica Botanica’, he commented with humor about the naming of _Linnaea borealis_ : “It is commonly believed that the name of a plant which is derived from that of a botanist shows no connection between the two… \[but\]... _Linnaea_ was named by the celebrated \[Jan Frederik\] Gronovius and is a plant of Lapland, lowly, insignificant, disregarded, flowering but for a brief space – after Linnaeus who resembles it”. It may not be an excessively objective statement.

_Thunbergia_ was named in 1780 by Retzius in honor of Carl Peter Thunberg (1743-1828), the Swedish naturalist, and perhaps the greatest pupil of Linnaeus. [_Kosteletzkya_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/69160) for Vincenz Franz Kosteletzky (1801-1887), Bohemian physician and botanist. [_Jacobsenia_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/246257%5D_) for Hermann Johannes Heinrich Jacobsen (1898-1978), German botanist and curator at Kiel botanic garden… there are many, many more examples.

Latin is still necessary at least to understand the species epithet. [_Ehrharta longiflora_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/175505), _longiflora_ referring to the elongate flowers of this species. And _Ehrharta_ ? J.F. Ehrhart (1742-1795) was a German botanist, yet another of Linnaeus’ pupils.

Sometimes scientific names bear the names of people who described the species or were instrumental in discovering them. Several archaeabacteria have been named in honor of Carl Woese (1928-), famous for defining the [archaea](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/2157) in 1977, such as [_Pyrococcus woesei_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/2262), or [_Methanobrevibacter woesei_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/190976) or [_Conexibacter woesei_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/191495).

[_Euzebya tangerina_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/591198), tangerine-colored bacterium was named in 2010 after Jean-Paul Euzéby, a French microbiologist who has contributed significantly to microbial systematics, including the Latinization of microbial names.

And [_Przewalskium albirostris_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/1088058) ? The Latin etymology of the name suggests that this creature has a white beak (albus: white and rostrum: beak, trunk or proboscis), or a white-lip. It was formerly named Cervus albirostris. _Cervus_ means deer!! Now we know: it is a white-lipped deer. But it was renamed _Przewalskium albirostris_ after N.M Przhevalsky (1839-1888), a Russian geographer.

In view of the names cited above, you may have the feeling of attending a popularity contest in the scientific community, but other kinds of tribute are also possible: a pheasant was named [_Chrysolophus amherstiae_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/9088) to commemorate Sarah Countess Amherst who sent the first specimen to London in 1828. In a more [recent past](https://www.uniprot.org/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17082386), a newly discovered bacterium was named [_Midichloria mitochondrii_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/234827). Does _Midichloria_ remind you of anything? [Schoooooooooooooooo…Luke, I am your father](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6sj89xgnl4). _Midichloria_, a gram-negative bacterium, takes its name from the Star Wars microbes, [midi-chlorians](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Midi-chlorian), which grant the Jedi and the Sith the ability to use the Force. In real life, _Midichloria mitochondrii_ are non-obligate symbionts that reside primarily in the mitochondria.

Of course the appreciation of people deserving a tribute remains questionable. A nice cactus has been called [_Rebutia einsteinii_](https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/432506), but there is no [_Opuntia_](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia) _oppenheimerii_ Why not _oppenheimerii_ ? Why a cactus? We leave the question open for the future generations of taxonomists.

## Clustal Omega replaces Clustal W as UniProt’s protein alignment program

We have upgraded the alignment web service used to align protein sequences in UniProt from Clustal W to [Clustal Omega](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21988835). This has been made possible with the help of a

new bioinformatics analysis tools framework at

EMBL -EBI. Clustal Omega is the latest addition to the Clustal family of programs. It offers a significant improvement upon Clustal W in the following areas:

- Accuracy – Better quality protein sequence alignments.

- Scalability – Better at aligning larger numbers of sequences.

- Speed – Faster alignments, making use of multiple processors where present.

Clustal Omega is currently only suitable for aligning protein sequences and not

DNA or

RNA sequences.
