[Post-translational modification](https://www.uniprot.org/help/post-translational_modification) data generated from large scale mass-spectrometry datasets that have then been reanalyzed via the PTMeXchange project. This facilitates confidence scoring of PTM sites across multiple datasets. The confidence score reflects the strength of the [evidence](https://www.uniprot.org/help/evidences) for modifications at that site.

# Where does the data come from?

The data comes from a refined set of large scale phosphoproteomic datasets available in the [PRIDE database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/). The links to each source dataset can be found in the expandable evidence tag section for each PTM, found next to the modification name in the ‘Description’ column of the table.

# How can I access this data in UniProt?

The data is viewable in multiple formats, via the [UniProt Proteins API (Proteomics PTM section)](https://www.uniprot.org/help/programmatic_access) and via the [protein entry page](https://www.uniprot.org/help/explore_uniprotkb_entry) under section header [PTM/Processing](https://www.uniprot.org/help/ptm_processing_section). Links to source databases [PRIDE](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/) and [PeptideAtlas](http://www.peptideatlas.org/) are provided for users to explore the data in more detail.
