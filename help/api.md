This document describes how this website can be accessed with programs. All resources (individual entries as well as sets of entries retrieved by queries) are accessible using simple URLs ( [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational%5FState%5FTransfer) ) that can be bookmarked, linked and used in programs.

Please consider providing a contact email address as part of the User-Agent header that your programs set. This will allow us to contact you in case of problems (see our [privacy notice](http://www.uniprot.org/help/privacy) ).
