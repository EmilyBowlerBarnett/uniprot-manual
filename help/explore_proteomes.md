You can filter your results by reference proteomes and other criteria depending on your search. A reference proteome is a well annotated proteome of model organisms and organisms of interest for biomedical research and phylogeny. 

The results table shows information such as Proteome ID, Organisms, Organism ID, the number of UniProtKB entries in the proteome, proteome completeness indicators - BUSCO and CPD, and Genome representation.
