- Firefox: Turn on the _Print Background Colors_ option
  1.  Select _File_ / _Print_ in the normal way.
  2.  In the _Print_ box, look for the subheading _Appearance_ or select the _Options_ tab.
  3.  Tick the _Print Background Colors_ option.
  4.  Click the _Print_ button at the bottom.
- Safari: Turn on the _Print Backgrounds_ option
  1.  Select _File_ / _Print_ in the normal way.
  2.  In the _Print_ box, tick the _Print backgrounds_ option
