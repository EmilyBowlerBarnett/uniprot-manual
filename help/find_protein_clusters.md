UniRef provides clustered sets of sequences from UniProtKB, including isoforms and selected UniParc records. (UniRef offers complete coverage of the sequence space at three resolutions:
* UniRef100 database combines identical sequences from any organism into a single UniRef entry, displaying the sequence of a representative protein, the accession numbers of all the merged entries and links to the corresponding UniProtKB and UniParc records. 
* UniRef90 is built by clustering UniRef100 sequences such that each cluster is composed of sequences that have at least 90% sequence identity to the longest sequence (the seed sequence) of the cluster. 
* UniRef50 is built by clustering UniRef90 seed sequences that have at least 50% sequence identity to the longest sequence in the cluster.)

You can access UniRef from the UniProt homepage or by selecting it from the dropdown in front of the search bar and entering your search term.

For example, let’s enter a query and click the search button.

You can now see the results for your query. You can filter your results by cluster identity level - 100, 90 or 50 per cent. You can also change to table view for a more detailed view of the results.

You can also customize your results table by clicking on “Customize data” to add or remove information.

You can select an entry to run a direct BLAST sequence similarity search on the representative sequence of the selected cluster or select multiple entries to run an alignment.

You can download entries in various formats and you can also save them for later by adding them to your basket. The selections in your basket remain until you delete them or clear your cookies.
