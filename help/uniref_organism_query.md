You can specify the organism by [taxonomy ID](https://www.uniprot.org/help/taxonomy_identifier) in the [advanced search](https://www.uniprot.org/help/advanced_search) options. For example, the link below searches for UniRef90 clusters with one or more members from Chinese hamster:

[taxonomy_id:10029 AND identity:0.9](https://www.uniprot.org/uniref?query=taxonomy_id%3A10029%20AND%20identity%3A0.9)
