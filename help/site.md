This subsection describes interesting single amino acid sites on the sequence that are not defined in any other subsection. This subsection can be displayed in different sections ('Function', 'PTM / Processing', 'Disease/Phenotypes and variants') according to its content.

Examples: [P00451](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00451), [Q10471](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q10471), [P80969](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P80969), [P02730](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P02730)

The 'Site' subsection is frequently used for:

# 1. Cleavage sites

Example: [P09884](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P09884)

When the protease is known, it is specified:  
Example: [Q8K1S2](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q8K1S2)

Autocatalytic cleavages are specified:  
Example: [Q02936](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q02936)

Related keyword: [Autocatalytic cleavage](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/68)

# 2. Inhibitory sites for proteases

Example: [P00995](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P00995)

When the protease that is subject to inhibition is known, it is specified:  
Example: [P01070](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/P01070)

Related keyword: [Protease inhibitor](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/646)

# 3. Breakpoint sites for fusion proteins due to chromosomal rearrangement

Example: [Q9UDY8](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/Q9UDY8)

Related keyword: [Chromosomal rearrangement](https://www.uniprot.org/keywords/160)

Each 'Site' subsection may refer to a single amino acid or to a peptide bond, which is represented by the positions of the two flanking amino acids.
